This is going to serve a mini-guide on validation/Hadronization.

Currently, the package is under restructuring.

The old classes are HadPlots and HadPlotter are still here.

The new classes are: RunConfig, Analyzer, ExpData, and GenPlots<Base>/<ChHadW2>.

The RunConfig knows how to read in am xml config that contains the list of
Genie's pre-generated samples.
It can also control the loop until the configuration is done.
It can command the Analyzer to analyze events based on what sample it's
currently on.

It's the Analyzer that can loop over Genie's pre-generated events, look at
specific observables, and at the end combine the outcome with exp.data plots.
It's all inside the Analyzer, incl. ExpData object (with some currently
hardcoded locations of the exp.datasets).

However, in the near future more work will be done on ExpData, to teach it how
to read in exp.,datasets from a config, etc.
ExpData will probably need to move out of the Analyzer and into RunConfig.

WORK IN PROGRESS !!!
